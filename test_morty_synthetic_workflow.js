// The target loan qualification output that we want to reverse-engineer inputs for
const targetLoanQualificationOutput = `**CRITICAL INCOME ANALYSIS:** Samantha's income consists of several components: Regular pay, Overtime, Bonuses, PTO, Retro Pay, and a significant portion from Charge Tips. To assess stability and continuity, we'll analyze her pay stubs for 2025 (YTD), 2024 (full year), and 2023 (full year), along with her W-2s. **1. Income Source Breakdown & Calculation:** * **Pay Frequency:** Bi-weekly. * **Most Recent Pay Stub (04/30/2025):** * Pay Period: 04/19/2025 - 05/02/2025 * Current Gross Pay: $5,085.92 * YTD Gross Pay: $48,824.56 * Number of pay periods YTD: $48,824.56 / $5,085.92 = **9.6 periods** (approximately 4 months of bi-weekly pay). * **Income Components Analysis:** * **Base/Regular Income:** * 2023 YTD (from 12/27/2023 pay stub): $26,975.47 * 2024 YTD (from 12/24/2024 pay stub): $34,845.84 * 2025 YTD (from 04/30/2025 pay stub): $12,033.30 * **Analysis:** Samantha's regular pay varies due to fluctuating hours and multiple hourly rates. The 2025 YTD average ($12,033.30 / 9.6 periods * 26 periods/year = $32,590.22) is higher than 2023 but slightly lower than 2024. For fluctuating hourly income, standard underwriting typically uses the **2-year average** for stability, unless a clear, documented increase (e.g., permanent raise) is provided. * **Qualifying Regular Income:** ($26,975.47 + $34,845.84) / 2 = **$30,910.66 annually** * **Monthly Regular Income:** $30,910.66 / 12 = **$2,575.89** * **Overtime Income:** * 2023 YTD (from 12/27/2023 pay stub): $1,325.28 * 2024 YTD (from 12/24/2024 pay stub): $2,938.34 * 2025 YTD (from 04/30/2025 pay stub): $9,020.23 * **Analysis:** Overtime has significantly increased in 2025 compared to previous years. While the current YTD projects to over $24,000 annually, for underwriting purposes, irregular income like overtime requires a **2-year history** of stability and continuity. The substantial jump in 2025 YTD is an inconsistency that would typically require further documentation (e.g., employer verification of guaranteed, continued higher hours) to be fully utilized. For conservative underwriting, we will use the 2-year average. * **Qualifying Overtime Income:** ($1,325.28 + $2,938.34) / 2 = **$2,131.81 annually** * **Monthly Overtime Income:** $2,131.81 / 12 = **$177.65** * **Charge Tips Income:** * 2023 YTD (from 12/27/2023 pay stub & W-2 Box 7): $47,311.49 * 2024 YTD (from 12/24/2024 pay stub & W-2 Box 7): $47,717.98 * 2025 YTD (from 04/30/2025 pay stub): $27,771.03 * **Analysis:** Tips are a significant portion of Samantha's income and show a strong, consistent history over the past two full years. The 2025 YTD projects to over $75,000 annually, which is a substantial increase. Similar to overtime, for irregular income, a **2-year average** is the standard for stability and continuity. While the current year shows a positive trend, using the 2-year average is more conservative and aligns with standard guidelines for variable income. * **Qualifying Tips Income:** ($47,311.49 + $47,717.98) / 2 = **$47,514.73 annually** * **Monthly Tips Income:** $47,514.73 / 12 = **$3,959.56** * **Bonus/PTO/Retro Pay:** * A bonus of $3,000.00 is shown in 2024, but no clear bonus history is present for 2023. Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac typically require a 2-year history for bonus income to be considered stable and recurring. Therefore, this will be **excluded** from qualifying income. * PTO ($1,000.00 in 2024) and Retro Pay ($77.30 in 2024) are generally not considered recurring qualifying income components. These will be **excluded**. **Total Qualifying Monthly Income:** * Regular: $2,575.89 * Overtime: $177.65 * Tips: $3,959.56 * **Total Qualifying Monthly Income: $6,713.10** **2. Asset Verification:** * **Checking Account:** $0.00 * **Analysis:** This is a **critical red flag**. Samantha has no liquid assets for a down payment, closing costs, or reserves. This will severely limit her eligibility for most traditional mortgage products. **3. Debt Analysis:** * **Total Liabilities:** $0.00 * **Monthly Debt Payments:** $0.00 * **Analysis:** This is a **significant strength**. Having no reported debt obligations means her Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio will be entirely driven by the proposed housing payment. * **Missing Information:** A full credit report is essential to confirm the absence of any undisclosed debts (e.g., credit cards, auto loans, student loans, etc.) that would impact her DTI. **4. Risk Assessment:** * **Strengths:** * **Strong, consistent employment history** with Satellite 169 LLC, evidenced by multiple years of W-2s and pay stubs. * **Stable and significant tip income** over a 2-year period. * **No reported recurring debt obligations**, which is a major compensating factor for DTI. * **Weaknesses/Red Flags:** * **Zero liquid assets** is the primary and most critical hurdle. This prevents qualification for any loan product requiring a down payment or funds for closing costs. * Fluctuating regular and overtime income, although addressed by using 2-year averages. The significant increase in 2025 YTD overtime and tips suggests potential for higher income, but requires further verification for underwriting use. * **Inconsistencies:** The current year's YTD overtime and tips are significantly higher than the previous two years' averages. While positive, for conservative underwriting, the 2-year average is used due to the variable nature of these income types. **5. Loan Amount and Product Qualification:** Given Samantha's financial profile, particularly the lack of assets, her qualification for a mortgage is **highly constrained**. * **Qualifying Monthly Income:** $6,713.10 * **Maximum Affordability (Hypothetical):** * Assuming a maximum Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio of 43% (a common threshold for conventional and FHA loans, though FHA can go higher with strong compensating factors), and with $0 other monthly debts: * Maximum Allowable Housing Payment (PITI + MI + HOA): $6,713.10 (Income) * 0.43 (Max DTI) = **$2,886.67** * Based on this maximum monthly payment, and assuming a 30-year fixed rate at current market rates (e.g., 7.0%) and estimated property taxes, insurance, and potential HOA/MIP (e.g., 1.5% of loan amount annually), a rough estimated maximum loan amount could be in the range of **$360,000 - $380,000**. * **However, this is purely hypothetical based on income and DTI.** * **Loan Product Qualification - The Primary Obstacle:** * **Conventional Loans (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac):** * **Not Viable without Assets:** Conventional loans typically require a minimum down payment of 3% (for first-time homebuyers) or 5% (for others), plus funds for closing costs (typically 2-5% of the loan amount) and reserves. With $0 assets, Samantha would **not qualify** for a conventional loan. * **FHA Loans:** * **Not Viable without Assets:** FHA loans require a minimum down payment of 3.5% of the purchase price. While FHA can be more flexible with DTI and credit scores, the asset requirement remains. Samantha would **not qualify** for an FHA loan without funds. * **VA Loans:** * **Unlikely:** VA loans offer 0% down payment, but are exclusively for eligible veterans. There is no information to suggest Samantha is a veteran. * **USDA Loans:** * **Unlikely:** USDA loans offer 0% down payment for properties in designated rural areas and have income limits. Miami Beach, FL, is highly unlikely to qualify as a USDA rural area, and we don't have information on property location or income limits for the area. * **The ONLY Potential Path: Down Payment Assistance (DPA) Programs or Gift Funds:** * Samantha's qualification is entirely contingent on her ability to secure **down payment assistance (DPA)** from a state, county, or local program, or receive a **gift fund** from an eligible donor (e.g., family member) that covers both the down payment and closing costs. * Many DPA programs are designed to help borrowers with limited assets. If she can find a DPA program she qualifies for, an **FHA loan** would likely be the most suitable product due to its flexibility with DTI and credit requirements (assuming her credit is good, which we cannot verify without a credit report). Some DPA programs also work with conventional loans. **Summary of Qualification:** Samantha Longo demonstrates strong, stable income capacity, particularly with her consistent tip earnings and absence of recurring debts. Her estimated qualifying monthly income is **$6,713.10**. However, her **zero liquid assets** are a critical impediment. She would **not qualify for standard conventional or FHA mortgage products** without a source of funds for a down payment and closing costs. **Recommendation:** * **Immediate Action Required:** The borrower must identify a source for down payment and closing costs. This could be: * A **Down Payment Assistance (DPA) program** (research local/state programs she may be eligible for). * A **gift fund** from a permissible donor, with appropriate gift letter and sourcing documentation. * **Further Documentation Needed:** * A **full credit report** is essential to verify the absence of all monthly debt obligations and assess her creditworthiness. * If pursuing a DPA program, specific program guidelines must be reviewed for income limits, property requirements, and DTI thresholds. * If the higher 2025 YTD overtime and tips are critical for qualification, additional documentation from her employer verifying the sustainability of these increased earnings would be required. Without a confirmed source of funds for the down payment and closing costs, Samantha is currently **not eligible** for a mortgage. If these funds are secured, she would likely be a strong candidate for an **FHA loan with DPA** or a **Conventional loan with DPA**, depending on the program's specifics and her credit profile.`;
